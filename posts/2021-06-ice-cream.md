My first big project in Blender, following an [insanely good tutorial by CG Geek](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLrjIgEdKLivgpCMmFC0_sV60Y_Ftp-WLD).

I was very proud when I finished it, but was still painfully aware that if there's an [uncanny valley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncanny_valley) equivalent for ice cream this render would surely fall into that category. Not the tutorial's fault, of course.

Some fun facts about the Uncanny Ice Cream:

- The ice cream itself is made from a star shape duplicated thousands of times along a bezier curve shaped as a spiral.
- I spent hours trying to get the ice cream spiral right because any tiny movement would screw up the whole thing. The mistake was not adding enough loops to the spiral.
- It blew my mind how easy it was to add texturize the ice cream and make it look frozen. It's amazing how much you can do so easily with Blender.
- The confetti is in fact just two confetto (yes, that's the singular form apparently) duplicated many times and then randomly glued to the surface using a particle system. You need to "paint" the surfaces where you want to have more particles.

What's hilarious is that at the end of the tutorial video series, Steve - the CG Geek - was like "okay then I made some adjustments and this is the final result" and then shows something so good it looks straight out of a Pixar movie. Unfortunately, said adjustments were not part of the tutorial.

Not complaining, though. This is one of the best tutorials for beginners out there and somehow it's entirely free! It's bonkers how you can find such good content online without paying for it. Steve, if you ever read this, thank you so much! ☀️
