An espresso machine made in Blender.

The idea for this project came when I bought a Breville Barista Express but I wanted it to have a more cartoonish appearance, so I ended up using the espresso maker from Animal Crossing: New Horizons as a reference.

Some fun facts about this one:

- Instead of assembling the machine body from loose parts I made it a single mesh. This was a mistake; the corners in the beveled areas became an n-gon nightmare.
- I couldn't get the crevices to look shadowy just with lightning, so I cheated and painted them dark gray.
- The shadow looks weird in several places and that's because back then I had no clue on how to light a scene properly (I still don't).
