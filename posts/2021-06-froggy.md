Early wins are vital when you're learning a new skill. Finishing something you're proud of early on without having to deal with a ton of frustration could be the difference between giving up or keep on learning.

One good way to come up with beginner-friendly project ideas is getting help from an expert. My usual approach is to find a private teacher (like how I did with French and Chinese), but Youtube has such great Blender tutorials for beginners that it took me months until I felt like I needed a teacher.

[Easy Froggy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rEBwBrRzyhw) here was the perfect tutorial for me. I was proud of the end result and felt comfortable deviating a little from the tutorial, even though I only made a minor tweak to make the t-shirt say "hi" in Chinese.
